# MetricTime
I've decided to invent new units for time which divide more evenly into ten. Where there were seconds, now there are "Seconts". Minutes? Try "Minits". As the Ours go by, we'll look back on the Deys before the advent of Metric Time, a modern measure of time for more modern Yeers.

What is Metric Time?
===================

Our current system for measuring time is archaic. One minute is 60 seconds? What? *Why?* We need a more up-to-date method of measuring the passage of time, one composed of more logical, divisible-by-ten units.

**Metric Time** attempts to solve this problem by defining seconds as fractions of years. Using Metric Time, the small "tick" unit analogous to a second, is defined as a one-hundred-millionth of three years. This unit of time shall be referred to as a **Secont**, or **st** for short. This means that 3 years is 100 **Mst**, or 100,000,000 **Seconts**.

While this may seem confusing and unintuitive at first, it's actually not that far off of our current system, producing a value of 1 Secont equal to 0.9467 seconds. And it gets better, let's see what other units we can define to produce a base-ten measure of time!

In real life, three hours make up 10,800 seconds. Let's define 3 **Ours** to be composed of exactly 10,000 **Seconts**.

3 Ours (3 O) = 10,000 Seconts (10 Kst)
===================

We'll need a unit between **Our** and **Secont** though, so let's further define an analogous unit to our minutes, known as **Minits**. We'll say 1 **Minit** is equal to 100 **Seconts**.

1 Minit (1 Mt) = 100 Seconts (100 st)
===================

Since our **Ours** are a bit shorter than real-world hours, let's define a **Dey** as 30 **Ours**, rather than 24. This is convenient in that the conversion between **Minits** and **Deys** is 10,000 an even multiple of ten.

1 Dey (1 Dy) = 30 Ours (30 O)
===================
1 Dy = 10 KMt = 100 Kst
===================


Our definition for **Seconts** was that 3 years would be composed of 100 **Mst**, so let's define a **Yeer** such that 3 **Yeers** is equal to 1000 **Deys**.

3 Yeers (3 Ye) = 1000 Deys (1 KDy)
===================
3 Ye = 30 KO = 1 MMt = 100 Mst
===================

Conveniently, if you convert 1 **Yeer** to seconds, you're left with the exact number of seconds in a year. This means that 1 **Yeer** = 1 year.

The only real downside to this is that, while **Yeers** will be years, our day to day measurements may change. Because there are 26 real-world hours in a **Dey**, and only 333 **Deys** in a year, our **Deys** don't really mean as much as they should (although, 2 **Deys** later means roughly the same as 2 days later, give or take 4 hours).

Take it or leave it, I think it's nice.
